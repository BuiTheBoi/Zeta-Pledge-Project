## Description:

This project allows a user to set the required information into a database in order to automate the watering of their plotted plants - saving them water, time, and energy.

At the beginning of the program, the user is walked through the process of entering in their new plants' information (name of plant, time to water the plant, and the amount of water needed in milimeters). If the user does not enter proper or sufficient information for their plant, the program will use the default information (name: "UNIDENTIFIED", time to water: 12 pm, amount of water: 30 ml). If the user wishes to return to an entry in the database to edit any piece of information, they would be walked through a new menu that lets them select the distinct variant that they choose to change.

When starting the machine, the program takes the current time and determines when the water the set plotted plants based on the information stored in the database. If the water storage does not have sufficient supply to finish the process, the user will get an error message displayed to alert them to replenish their supply.
